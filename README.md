# BlueBox
BlueBox 3D Printer. Based in Ultimaker

This is a work in progress. The BlueBox is a 3D large volume printer based in the great Ultimaker printer, but more scalable (its also designed a Big BlueBox model) and easy to make by using aluminium profiles and easy to mount designed printed parts. Me and  Bernardo, good friend and collaborator in the BlueBox project, have a great lack of time, and the prototypes are not completely mounted. If you want to help in the development, or use the files to make your own fork, feel free to do. If you contact me, I`ll try to help you in any question if I can.
The Big BlueBox and certain BOM and lists of materials will be upload in the future if I can find them.
